          Hey there! I&apos;m Alex. Some people also call me Peal. It&apos;s nice to meet you!

        <br></br>

        <p>
          I&apos;m currently a student at Virginia Tech majoring in computer science. Outside of school, I&apos;ve interned at <a href="https://appian.com/" className="text-blue-500 no-underline hover:underline">Appian</a> and <a href="https://gdmissionsystems.com/" className="text-blue-500 no-underline hover:underline">General Dynamics Mission Systems</a>,
          competed in and organized hackathons such as <a href="https://vthacks.com/" className="text-blue-500 no-underline hover:underline">VTHacks</a>,
          worked as a teaching assistant and research intern at Virginia Tech&apos;s computer science department, and represented <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html" className="text-blue-500 no-underline hover:underline">Intel</a> as a 
          student ambassador.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <p>
          I&apos;m most interested in infrastructure and low-level development, but I&apos;m at my happiest as long as I&apos;m learning new things alongside great people. In
          my free time, you&apos;ll catch me watching football, trying new restaurants, or starting a new anime.
