          Hello!
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <p>
          I&apos;m a student at&nbsp;
          <a href="https://cs.vt.edu/" className="text-blue-500 no-underline hover:underline">Virginia Tech</a>
          &nbsp;exploring computer science.
          There, I work as a teaching assistant for CS 2104: Problem Solving in CS, and as a volunteer researcher at the&nbsp;
          <a href="https://hume.vt.edu/" className="text-blue-500 no-underline hover:underline">Hume Center</a>.&nbsp;
          I also help organize <a href="https://vthacks.com/" className="text-blue-500 no-underline hover:underline">VTHacks</a>,
          one of the largest student-run hackathons on the East Coast, by leading the development of our website and check-in tools
          that accommodate over 1000 registrants.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <p>
          Outside of school, I&apos;ve worked on developing robust user interfaces for testing frameworks at&nbsp;
          <a href="https://gdmissionsystems.com/" className="text-blue-500 no-underline hover:underline">General Dynamics Mission Systems</a>,
          where my work was demonstrated to Department of Defense contractors in competitions for multi-million dollar contracts.
          I&apos;ve also spent my summers teaching kids how to code, build robots, and do math at&nbsp;
          <a href="https://www.fairfaxcollegiate.com/" className="text-blue-500 no-underline hover:underline">Fairfax Collegiate</a>.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <p>
          I'm particularly interested in back-end development, cloud computing, high-performance computing, and distributed systems.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <p>
          On the weekends, you'll probably find me watching&nbsp;
          <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en" className="text-blue-500 no-underline hover:underline">Chelsea F.C.&apos;s</a> latest fixture,
          organizing my ever-growing&nbsp;
